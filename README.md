# Anaerobic-Digestion-Model-No.1-ADM1-
This is a MATLAB implementation of Anaerobic Digestion Model No.1 (ADM1), developed by the International Water Association (IWA), see https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2002.0292

Parameters may be adjusted using `ADM1_input.xlsx`. 

The code has been validated against Benchmark Simulation 2 (BSM2), details of which may be found here: http://iwa-mia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BSM_TG_Tech_Report_no_3_BSM2_General_Description.pdf. 

When using the parameters provided in `ADM1_input_BSM2_defaults.xlsx`, the results align with those reported in BSM2.
